## Integration Plan for GitHub Repository

1. **Add a notes folder** to the repository to separate high‑level planning documents from app code. Store architecture docs or business plans in `/docs` or `/notes`.

2. **Commit the business plan file**:
    - Download prepared plan file.
    - Rename to something descriptive like `3d-printing-business-plan.md` and add to the new `notes` folder.
    - Commit addition on a new branch (e.g., `notes/add-business-plan`) and open a pull request for review.

3. **App-Development README update**:
    - After merging, update `app-development/README.md` with:
      ```
      See [../notes/3d-printing-business-plan.md](../notes/3d-printing-business-plan.md) for the overall business plan.
      ```

4. **Document an upkeep process**:
    - Create `notes/upkeep.md` detailing collaboration (branching, PRs, commit messages, issue tracking).
    - Include naming conventions for notes (e.g., `notes/filament-suppliers.md`, `notes/sales-analysis-Q1.md`).

5. **Ongoing maintenance**:
    - When prompted, update Markdown as needed; copy changes, commit, and push.
    - All contributors (human or AI) should follow branch‑and‑PR procedure to avoid conflicts.
    - Periodically review the notes folder to archive/delete outdated materials, and link new insights from the main plan.

With this structure, the repository will become both the codebase and living documentation for the business. Team members and AIs can find and update relevant notes without interfering with app code.
